- 🟦 **Paper**  
- 🟧 **Plastic**  
- 🟩 **Glass**  
- 🟫 **Organic**

The game combines **fun, challenge, and learning**. Kids (and adults!) can practice recognizing everyday waste items and learn **what belongs in which bin**.

## 🧑‍🏫 Educational Goals

The game is designed for **children and young learners**. It aims to:

- Encourage **environmentally responsible habits** through play.  
- Teach the basics of **sorting recyclable materials**.

## 🚀 Future Ideas

The current version is a **Level 1 prototype**, but the framework is expandable:

- 🔧 **Advanced levels**: Items that need to be **disassembled** before sorting (e.g., juice boxes with plastic + paper layers).  
- ❌ **Tricky items**: Introduce things that *look recyclable but aren’t* (like used napkins, greasy pizza boxes).  
- 🏭 **Extra bins**: Add more waste streams such as metal, electronics, or hazardous waste.  
- 🧩 **Mini-games**:  
  - Disassemble objects into components.  
  - Quick quizzes between rounds.  
- 🌍 **Localization**: Adapt rules to match different countries’ recycling systems.  
- 📱 **Mobile-ready**: Already responsive, but could be polished for tablets/phones.
